## Our Story

The Spokane Home Automation User Group was created by Dennis and Kirt in 2025 to bring together Home Assistant enthusiasts in the Spokane area.

## What We Do

We meet monthly to share our passion for home automation, learn from each other, and explore the latest features in Home Assistant. Our meetings include:

- **Project Showcases** - Members demonstrate their latest automation projects, custom dashboards, and smart home setups
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Tips, tricks, and best practices from the community
- **Troubleshooting Sessions** - Get help with your Home Assistant challenges
- **Community Building** - Connect with local smart home enthusiasts

## Meeting Details

**When:** First Tuesday of every month at 7:00 PM
**Where:** Denny's on North Division, Spokane

Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level. Whether you're just curious about Home Assistant or you're running a complex multi-device setup, we'd love to have you join us!
