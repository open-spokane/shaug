# December 2025 Meeting Recap

We had another great meeting for the Spokane Home Assistant Users Group tonight! The session featured some exciting presentations and productive discussions about our growing community.

## Website Collaboration

We kicked things off with a discussion about building our website and exploring how each member can contribute to the organization. It's exciting to see the group coming together to create resources that will benefit both current and future members.

## What's New in Home Assistant

Jesse led us through a comprehensive presentation covering the latest features in the newest version of Home Assistant. It's always valuable to stay up-to-date with the platform's evolution and discover new capabilities we can leverage in our smart home setups.

## Dashboard Showcase: Dennis's Star Trek Console

The highlight of the evening was Dennis's presentation of some incredibly cool dashboards. The standout was a dashboard designed to look like a Star Trek engineering console - a perfect blend of functionality and fandom that shows just how creative and customizable Home Assistant can be!
